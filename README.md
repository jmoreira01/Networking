# Networking

### 1. [[Basic Network Configuration](Basic-Network-Configuration.md)]
- **Description**: This project demonstrates the configuration of a network using a Cisco router, including IP assignment, DHCP setup, and connectivity for multiple devices (PCs and switches). The network features three subnets: 10.255.255.0/24, 172.31.255.0/24, and 192.168.29.0/24, all connected to a central router.
- **Notes**: All commands and configurations were tested in a simulated environment (CISCO Packet Tracer).

### 2. [[Advanced VLAN Network](Network-Cybersecurity-Administrator_Practical-Lab.md)]

- **Description:** Advanced network implementation featuring hierarchical design with 5 switches and central router on Cisco Packet Tracer. Includes VLAN segmentation, VLSM addressing, inter-VLAN routing, and comprehensive security configurations. The network implements four VLANs (ADMIN, ACCOUNT, COMERCIAL, MANAGEMENT) with proper isolation and secure management access.
- **Features:** VLSM addressing with 172.18.0.0/16 network | VTP domain for VLAN propagation | Router-on-a-stick for inter-VLAN routing | DHCP services for user VLANs | DNS and HTTP services | VLAN isolation | SSH management restricted to management VLAN | Secure trunk configurations with DTP disabled
